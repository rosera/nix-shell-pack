Yarez. It's Conc who's engaged with him.
Ezri Cona striding on and finding Ollie
Watkins [cheering]
who slides it wide. But Villa's biggest
moment of the match so far.
>> What an opportunity. No wonder he's
disappointed. I think it came off his
heel and you're just thinking he's going
to sweep one into the far corner.
[cheering]
crossov with the ball in. The header is
over.
Launching himself at it. So many down
the earth just anticipating getting
ahead of his man and he needs a subtle
touch. That's not an easy one, but
you're throwing yourself at him.
>> REAL DISTURBS THE GOALKEEPER AND GETS IT
over the line.
He made his presence felt in front of
EMBI MARTINEZ WHO CAME OFF SECOND BEST.
IT'S A challenge on in by Gabrielle, but
he pulls Gabrielle's shirt there first.
You can see he just hits the defender.
Odigard running it from Sancho.
Brilliant ball through
[cheering]
Arsenal are flying now. Oh god. Scores
on Saturday.
And that is a big big assist for him and
this could be a big goal in the context
of tonight's
cross
trying to keep it alive.
TRAN
[cheering]
A BEAUTIFUL CLEAN strike from Leandro
Trasard that surely settles this match
now.
IA losing out to Subu Mendy. A crossards
made the run on ahead of him. Sucker on
the far side. His fall back for Jesus is
just on.
And what an instant [cheering] impact.
Gabrielle Jesus two days short of a year
since his last goal in a win at
Brenford. Comes on with a bang and makes
it 4-nil.
CROSS BY DANIEL Watkins
off the POST AND [cheering] MCIN CAN'T
GET IT IN either because it's another
remarkable stop from David Ryer. Amazing
agility again from the goalkeeper to get
back across and deal with it after it
had first come back off the woodwork.
This is Maron.
Stopped initially by Jesus but he's
persevered. DANIEL MARON AND Watkins
this time does get it in the net. There
will be no clean sheet for Arsenal and
it was the persistence of Daniel Maron
that made that really. Rya finally
beaten.
